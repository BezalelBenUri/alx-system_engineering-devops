**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** The outage occurred from 2:30 PM to 4:45 PM (GMT) on March 10, 2023.
- **Impact:** The outage affected our web application, resulting in slow response times and intermittent unavailability. Approximately 30% of our users experienced service disruptions during this period.

**Timeline:**

- **2:30 PM:** Issue detected by monitoring alert.
- **2:45 PM:** Initial investigation began, focusing on network and server issues.
- **3:15 PM:** Misleading path taken when suspected network congestion.
- **3:30 PM:** Incident escalated to the infrastructure team.
- **4:15 PM:** Root cause identified and resolution implemented.
- **4:45 PM:** Service fully restored.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured firewall rule. During routine maintenance, a network engineer inadvertently altered a firewall rule affecting the load balancer, causing it to block incoming traffic. As a result, legitimate user requests were being denied, leading to the slowdown and intermittent unavailability of the web application.

To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:

- The infrastructure team, upon escalation, identified the misconfigured firewall rule as the likely cause.
- The firewall rule was quickly reverted to its previous state, allowing traffic to flow correctly.
- To prevent a similar incident, we implemented stricter change control procedures for firewall rule modifications.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

To prevent future incidents and improve our response to such situations, we are taking the following corrective and preventative measures:

1. **Change Control Process Enhancement:** We will revise our change control procedures to include thorough reviews and approvals before implementing changes to critical network configurations.

2. **Firewall Rule Auditing:** Regular audits and automated checks will be implemented to detect and prevent misconfigured firewall rules.

3. **Improved Monitoring:** We will enhance our monitoring system to provide more immediate alerts and improve visibility into network and application performance.

4. **Documentation Update:** Ensure that all configurations and changes are thoroughly documented, so that any future troubleshooting can be expedited.

5. **User Communication:** Establish a clear communication plan for notifying users during service disruptions, and improve our status page to provide real-time updates.

6. **Training and Awareness:** Conduct training sessions for the network team to raise awareness about the criticality of accurate firewall configurations.

**Conclusion:**

The outage, caused by a misconfigured firewall rule, led to a brief disruption in our web application services, affecting around 30% of our users. This incident highlighted the need for enhanced change control procedures and better monitoring. By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to ensure the stability and reliability of our services and minimize the impact of similar issues in the future. We apologize for any inconvenience this outage may have caused and appreciate your patience as we work to improve our systems.
